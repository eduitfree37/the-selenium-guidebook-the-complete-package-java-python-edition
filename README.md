The Selenium Guidebook offers comprehensive resources including video walkthroughs and cheat sheets tailored to meet the needs of testing professionals. From beginners seeking a smooth introduction to advanced testers embarking on automation implementation, to developers aiming to grasp Selenium and its effective implementation, our content is designed to cater to diverse skill levels and interests.
It's no secret that Selenium has problems

Some of the well known offenders include...
- It's slow
- Tests are brittle
- You get false positives & finicky results
- It's a real maintenance nightmare

But what most people don't realize is this: Selenium has a bigger problem, and these are just symptoms of it.

The BIG Problem With Selenium

The problem is simple, and yet, a real challenge to solve -- INFORMATION.

Did you know that all of the problems mentioned above are solvable? Well, they are. And most people don't know that. There's either too much information to sift through, not enough for your context, it's out of date, nobody knows about it, or someone solved for it and never shared their experience.

The future is already here, it's just not very evenly distributed.
-William Gibson

Information Overload

Unfortunately there are more resources to dig through than you have time or know what to do with.

With blogs, videos, documentation, forums, meetups, conferences, books, and mailing lists, the signal to noise ratio is all out of whack. This is because none of these resources were designed to help you use Selenium successfully.

They may help you cobble together parts of a solution, solving short term problems. But odds are what you come up with will ultimately turn into something slow and brittle that is rife with false positives that is hard to maintain and untrusted by you and your team.

Wouldn't It Be Nice To Have Reliable Test Results You And Your Team Could Trust?

It's not your fault that this is the end result of your hard work. You were set up for failure before you even started. So let's level the playing field.

In order to use Selenium effectively, here is a list of what you need to do:

Decompose an existing web application to identify what to test
Identify which browsers to test with
Pick the best language for you and your team
Setup Selenium to work with each browser you care about
Write maintainable and reusable Selenium tests that will be cross-browser compatible and performant
Build an integrated feedback loop to automate test runs and find issues fast
Setup your own infrastructure or connect to a cloud provider
Dramatically improve test times with parallelization
Navigate the Selenium landscape to find information on your own
How do you stack up? Odds are you have some of these points nailed down. But wouldn't you rest easier knowing you had all of them?

You Can Make This Happen and "The Selenium Guidebook" will teach you how

Write tests that you and your team can trust with the techniques in "The Selenium Guidebook". With them you will be able to release software with confidence, knowing that your application has stable, fast, and working tests that cover everything that matters.

You Don't Need To Be A Developer To Do This

In order to do automated testing well you don't need to be a Developer, but you do need to write some code. But don't worry, I'll show you the bits you need to know along with some simple examples to help you get comfortable with these concepts and quickly put them into practice.
